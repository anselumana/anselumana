Hi,
I'm Ansel Umana, a 23 years old backend developer deeply focused on blockchain technologies and analysis.
I have an innate curiosity and strong passion for the entire crypto space, I love experimenting with new technologies and learning new skills.
I've started my journey in software development 4 years ago as a python self-taught, and today I've matured a solid 3+ years of experience developing backend solutions for large enterprises and startups in the financial and IoT fields.
I'm currently working hard to improve my skills in order to become part of a blockchain-focused company, and I'm sure that thanks to my determination and great vision I will soon be at the forefront of other pioneers like me.
